# What this all is about

So at some point I wanted to learn scheme and functional programming.

As I had heard, the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs is a good manual on this subject, and it comes with a problem set.

So I solved the problem set in "as pure scheme as possible".

This still required three SRFI libraries: SRFI-27, SRFI-18 and SRFI-159; and three non-standard libraries: (chibi ast), (chibi process) and (chibi time). The rest is pure R7RS-red.
