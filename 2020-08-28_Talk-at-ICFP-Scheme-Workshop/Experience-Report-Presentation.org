- In high school we cross out the tasks as they appear in a problem set.
- We feel better as things progress.
- Measuring problem difficulty requires sequentiality.
- Org can be compiled into a wbs-chart (not implemented)

- Noise can be fought with headphones.
- Pomodoro did not work because I could not fit problems in chunks reasonably.
