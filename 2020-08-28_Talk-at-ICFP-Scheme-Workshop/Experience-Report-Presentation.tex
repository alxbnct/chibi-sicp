\note{Note
In this talk I want to speak about a very famous book by two very famous MIT professors.
It is called ``Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs''.
This book, as well as the course it is associated with, are considered among the most unconventional among the programming courses to day.
(Although HTDP rivals it.)
It is \uline{still} unconventional, even though 35 years have passed, and it would be reasonable to expect that the techniques considered innovative would become an everyday norm.
This hasn't happened to the extend expected. 
Why?
To find out why, and also to become a better programmer, was my aim at the start of the project.
I once heard that those who passed SICP are among the best programmers in the world.}

\note{Note
I hope that this report can be useful to people who deal with computer science education in their daily life.
Curricula are seldom a subject of independent scrutiny, and the two parties taking part in the education process are likely to suspect each other of dishonesty.
Therefore, having an independent assessment that can be trusted will happen to be a valuable contribution.
This is especially valid now, when there is an increasing trend on making education a more remote and a more solitary process.
Furthermore, it is also becoming increasingly computerised, so both parties can get some benefit from that, if knowing how to.}

\note{Note
Naturally, paper is still the most commonly used result of education.
In a better case, the paper is written by the students, and they remember a bit by writing.
In a worse case, it is handed out to the students by a lecturer, and kept as a memory of the good old days.
Students are usually not prepared for the university educational process, and don't know how to behave in order to make this time the most useful.
As a consequence, most of the work done by the students during studies becomes worthless right after a deserved mark is written into the transcript.
However, if approached open-mindedly, at least two possible applications for the work done in a learning time can be thought of.
Firstly, university knowledge can be processed into a "canned brain food" for later queries.
Secondly, the coursework and/or lectures can be formatted as a piece of portfolio to be presented to an interviewer at a job position.
It's a shame that students are seldom told that before their first lectures.
I tried to imagine what a "perfect coursework submisstion format" should be.
It should retain the consistency, time and machine independence of a book.
But at the same time, it should be searchable, version-controlled and runnable.
A so-called "notebook" format similar to Jupyter thus appeared.}

\begin{frame}[label={sec:org7d99361}]{Which tools I ended up using.}
\begin{columns}[t]
\begin{column}{0.35\columnwidth}
\begin{block}{An Ideal Student}
\begin{itemize}
\item Study everything, but nothing above the required curriculum.
\item Try to follow the ``Free Software Way''.
\item Try to use the tools available in 1996. (Within reason.)
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{column}

\begin{column}{0.45\columnwidth}
\begin{block}{Software}
\begin{itemize}
\item Emacs
\item org-mode (babel)
\item Chibi-Scheme
\item GNU Fortran
\item TikZ
\item PlantUML
\item git
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{column}
\end{columns}

\note{Note
\begin{itemize}
\item Of course, TikZ and PlantUML did not exist in 1985.
\item Chibi-Scheme also did not exist.
\item Scheme existed, obviously, in the form of r4rs. Now we have r7rs.
\item TikZ could have been METAPOST.
\item git could have been RCS. It is a shame that people still cannot use git while at uni.
\item PlantUML did not exist, but I find it very useful to be able to adapt SICP's illustrations to standard diagrams.
\end{itemize}}

\item No experience with Scheme
\item No experience with UML
\item Little experience with TikZ

\end{column}
\end{columns}

\note{Note
\begin{itemize}
\item I am giving this information so that people who are consulting the solution be able to rescale the difficulty to themselves or the target audience.
\item Initially I thought that having certain programming experience should make me solve SICP's problem set noticeably faster than a newbie would. Doesn't seem to be the case.
\item Full time employment meant that I only had weekends and evenings for work. Still, students usually have classes and other courses.

\note{Note
This is an example of how the solution looked like.
On the right you can see the file's minimap.
On the left, there is a typical example of two solved problems.
As I mentioned, a "notebook format" had to be found.
It is called "org-mode".
Look at the code block and the result.
An instant benefit, which eventually served as a main substance of this report, is automatic gathering of measure.
In particular, progress, completion time, and session start and finish time stamps (in  a separate file).}

\note{Note
TikZ is quite verbose.
I used tikz when the exercises required drawing something.
I also redrew several figures with Tikz, as I wanted to be able to reproduce the book's narrative in my own classes (if/when I am going to give them).
Where possible, I tried to use more specific drawing tools.
Note, I did \uline{not} use TikZ for the "Functional Drawing", the so-called "Picture Language" part of SICP. 
For it I had to implements my own library, using Imagemagick.}

\note{Notes
PlantUML's biggest drawback is that its syntax is ugly and fragile.
However, the team behind it is working on improving the tool, and it seems that they are learning in the process.
UML is not an as pathetic thing as it is usually thought.
Standard tools for code visualisation are certainly worth considering.
On the other hand, environment diagrams, or essentially debugging interfaces, had to be drawn with TikZ.
Which I find amusing.
Such a feature is still not possible to implement portably.}

\item I didn't manage to collect and reprocess memory from modern messengers.
\item The videos are like "ahh, that's what they actually meant by what they said."
\item In general, seeing "how much I have already done!" and "there is a limited amount of things to do" is a great feeling that makes you get back to work.
\item IRC is still a useful tool.

\note{Note
Problem statistic is indicative.
I first solved the Exercises 1.1 and 1.2, and then turned to the Figure 1.1.
But it is displayed earlier, because it is earlier in the book.

Solving problems has a little bit of robustness to non-sequentiality.
In general, SICP tries to enforce sequentiality by making problems depend on one another, and this gives the noweb-like features of SICP a great value.

Having time tracking data in a machine-accessible format made it possible to do the analysis.}

\note{Notes
Not really readable graphs depict the distribution of the three measures of the dataset.
Problems that take more days than sessions are essentially the days when I needed a holiday.
But students also have holidays.
Why exactly the problem set obeys a log-normal distribution?
The two most difficult problems take most of the time.
To me it would mean that those have to be broken into smaller bits.
Even though is says "translate scheme to a low-level language line by line", the runtime support is huge, and not very well explained in SICP.
Input-output is not explained at all.
This is not what students usually do in the university, but perhaps it is not such a bad thing.}

\note{Note
This project gave birth to a healthy amount of by-products.
The most universally useful is probably the bug fix in gnu fortran, which I used for the last two exercises.
Twice I got a remark from old software writers that "software never dies".
I didn't manage to port PSD to a modern Emacs, but this probably can be done eventually.

Let's talk about portability.
Even though SICP is believed to be a book about scheme, it is still not possible to finish it with a scheme system supporting only the base standard, even if it is r7rs.
The critical points are multi-threading, randomness, and most prominently, graphics.
I think that this is a drawback, and should be addressed.
I already submitted an srfi on the most unportable part.
The second, one on the parts that are implementable with the help of other SRFIs, is in the plans.}

\note{Notes
On this slide I want to once again restate that for me this project can be seen as a model according to which university coursework could be considered.
Having an established notion of a "standard coursework" would allow to calibrate one's own perception.
Am I late or ahead?
Do I have enough time scheduled for the work?
Where am I in the process.
How do I recall the learned topics in the future?

Same things apply to the teachers, only regarding their students.
In addition, it may be mildly nice for the teachers to have an example of a "well-done coursework" that can be shown to the students.
Obviously, a single-point estimate is not very good.
Teachers have a power over their student, at least in the form of exposing them to the existence of this report.}

\item A full year of work. (Three months of raw time.)
\item Fitting SICP into one semester seems hard.
\item Almost no superfluous topics.
\item Several subjects are omitted.
\item Many by-products.
\item Lots of software is buggy.
\item Learning requires audacity.
\item Computer-assisted learning goes smoother.

\note{Notes
This course is hard.
Can I say that it is needlessly hard?
It certainly requires spending a lot of time on learning things that are not even mentioned in the book.
In fact, the book looks more like a companion to the MIT course than a standalone work.
I hope that the SRFIs and this Report can compensate for that a little bit, and help those trying to solve SICP in the future by sawing off the sharp corners.
All of this took roughly one year, including the Report and the SRFIs.
Learning while being employed is certainly possible, but hard.
Computing models presented in SICP seem not obsolete.
